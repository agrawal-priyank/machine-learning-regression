## Machine Learning Regression: House Sales Price Prediction Models

### Description
* Implemented linear regression and k nearest neighbors algorithm with gradient descent optimization to make an optimal model for predicting house prices using the Seattle King County dataset.
* Performed feature engineering and selection using lasso and ridge penalties to eliminate features which had little or no impact on the residual sum of squares error.
